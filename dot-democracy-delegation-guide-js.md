## Ivy DOT Democracy Delegation Guide

**Description**: This document provides an overview of how to delegate DOT voting power to the Ivy wallet. 

**Assumptions**: This guide assumes that you are using the PolkadotJS as a Polkadot wallet in either Google Chrome or Firefox. 

In the event you are using a Ledger (even via Polkadot JS), please visit [Ivy’s website](https://delegate.ivynetwork.io/), which enables democracy delegations on the highest priority OpenGov tracks, otherwise, you’ll have to do all 15 track delegations as individual transactions. It would clearly be amazing if you’d be open to doing so, but in order to streamline the democracy delegation process, we wanted to make it easier for potential democracy delegators. 


### Ivy Delegation Overview - OpenGov


1. Make sure that you have more than 2 transferable DOT in your wallet.
2. Visit this link: [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/referenda](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/referenda).
3. Press the Delegate button on the right of the screen.

4. A delegate vote box should appear:

  First, ensure that “apply delegation to all tracks” is on - this is done via a toggle switch below:

  This is paramount, otherwise the delegation process will not work as intended. 


  The dot should be on the right side of the “apply delegation to all tracks” button below the “delegate from account” drop-down.


  If “apply delegation to all tracks” is not on, you will see an additional drop-down menu called “submission track.” 


  Before moving on to the next step, please double check that “apply delegation to all tracks” is on.



5. In the same delegate votes box, enter the amount of DOT democracy you want to delegate in the delegated vote value.

6. In the same delegate votes box, select the conviction you want to delegate with.

  For reference, here are the current multiplier lock-ups in terms of days:


  1x: 7 days 


  2x: 14 days


  3x: 28 days (same as staking)


  4x: 56 days 


  5x: 112 days 


  6x: 224 days

7. Press Next.

8. Paste the Ivy account id: [16Zw7drubm8LkaoNSPtNBAaoq2bQAL4m7oySPp4RuXvmETDG](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16Zw7drubm8LkaoNSPtNBAaoq2bQAL4m7oySPp4RuXvmETDG) under “delegate to address” and press Delegate.

10. To check to see if the transaction was successful, enter your wallet address on [Polkadot Subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/) or head back to: [https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts). You should see that the amount of DOT that you delegated is now “locked” to denote that you have delegated democracy votes.
