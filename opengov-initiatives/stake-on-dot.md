### **#stakeondot**

Decentralized governance is a beautiful concept as it allows actors to coordinate efforts and signal initiatives. The Polkadot 2.0 era has introduced the most advanced decentralized governance framework in web3, effectively creating the largest functioning DAO.

We propose coordinating a campaign - **#stakeondot.** We invite and support everyone in Polkadot to rally around promoting the Polkadot Staking Narrative or embrace one of the other hyper bullish ecosystem themes.

To signal our support for ecosystem agents bull posting the Polkadot narratives, we have proposed a referenda tipping Alice Und Bob for his high-brain posting to date.

One of crypto’s most appealing use cases is staking to earn rewards on proof-of-stake networks.

It’s a great way to accumulate more of a token, especially during less bullish periods.

Some networks offer better rewards than others. Some provide better experiences than others.

But it's challenging to find a staking opportunity better than the one in Polkadot!

Polkadot rewards are attractive! ([https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview)).

Polkadot’s staking experience also has a number of outstanding features:

(1) Can compound rewards or claim them immediately,

(2) Flexible staking experience (nomination pools with as little as 1 DOT or choose your own validator sets - good video from Alice und Bob on staking[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmpvYBbMANw&t=97s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmpvYBbMANw&t=97s) ),

(3) Flexible custodial setups with proxies,

(4) ~50% of DOT has been staked to validators, signalling strong network security.

(5) Vote on governance proposals or delegate your vote to a collective.

The staking narrative is heating up across the crypto industry. Many variants of staking narratives are emerging, catching the attention of retail and institutional investors.

Whether it's liquid staking derivatives, restaking derivatives, liquid governance derivatives or staking nomination derivatives, staking is one of the obvious attraction points in today's landscape.

The DOT crowdloan unlocks present a massive opportunity for any investor, private or institutional, to take a position in DOT.

In a coordinated effort amongst all Polkadot agents, let's put Polkadot front of mind. It's time for us to be tweet bull posting our staking narrative! #stakeondot
